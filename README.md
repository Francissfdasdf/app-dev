> "The Great Gatsby" In 2013 Luhrmann released The Great Gatsby, his much-anticipated version of American icon F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel of the same name. The film starred DiCaprio as the title character.
These are my favorite scene of the movie

1.The Green Light:
Throughout the story, Gatsby is obsessed with a green light at the end of Daisy's dock, which symbolizes his hopes and dreams for their future together. The scene where Gatsby is seen reaching out toward the green light across the water is poignant, representing his longing and the unreachable nature of his desires.

2.The Plaza Hotel Confrontation:
In the climactic scene, Gatsby, Tom, Daisy, and Nick find themselves at the Plaza Hotel. Tensions escalate as the truth about Gatsby's relationship with Daisy comes to light. The confrontation is filled with tension and emotion, highlighting the complex dynamics between the characters and the underlying themes of love, wealth, and deception.
